Hey Everyone !! <br>
This is my first JS project named Leet Metrics <br>
Many software developers solve coding questions on leetcode and all his data of submission and solved question comes there <br>
In this project we made something in which user can just enter his/her leetcode id name on our webpage's search box and his entire leetcode data comes there. <br><br>

SPECIAL NOTE : <br>
When you open this for the first time and try accessing your data you'll found the message "No data found"<br>
Reason : <br>
We use API to access leetcode data.. But leetcode data can't be access straight forward. We used "cors anywhere demo server" which gives temporary access<br>
to the demo server. The link is in the code but I provide you here also.. <br>
As it is temporary , the server get closed after 1 hour so you have to request again 
So before checking out my website make sure to go to the following link and request access there <br>
